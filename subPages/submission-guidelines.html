                quality, presentation and relevance through a double-blind
                review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld

                    information need to be included in the final camera ready

                    portal. The PDF file of the review manuscript should not

                    Remove acknowledgments of identifying names and funding
                    sources from the PDF file that you will submit for review.
                    This information can be included in the final camera ready
                    manuscript if your paper gets accepted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove project titles or names that can be used to trace
                    back to the authors via a web search engine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use care in naming your files. Source file names (e.g.,
                    “Alice-n-Bob.dvi”) are often embedded in the final output as
                    accessible comments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use care in referring to your previous works as related
                    works. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this
                    leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead,
                    you can reference your past work in the third person format,
                    just like any other piece of related work by another author.
                    For example, instead of “In a previous work [10], we have
                    presented a data diffusion methodology …,” sentences in the
                    spirit of “In a previous work [10], the authors have
                    presented a data diffusion methodology …” should be used or
                    “XYZ et al. [10] have presented a data diffusion methodology
                    …”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Papers with the same title and abstract should not be posted
                    on a public website, such as arxiv.org, or transmitted via
                    public mailing lists.

                During the initial manuscript submission process via cmt, it is
                the authors’ responsibility to ensure that all the authors’
                names are included in the cmt submission page, and NOT in the
                PDF file. In particular, the cmt registration page must include
                all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to
                comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn
                from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of
                an accepted paper cannot be changed in the final manuscript.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                All submissions should be written in English with a maximum page
                length of SIX (6) printed pages for the regular paper track.
                Papers should be in PDF format, two columns, (minimum 10-point
                font) or greater and compliant with other AICARE 2025 manuscript

                The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution
                after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Xplore) if
                the paper is not presented at the conference.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain
                plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other
                conference at the same time (double submission). These matters
                are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society
                will take action against any author who engages in either
